----------

This a repository contains an implementation of NUEDC-2018-F subject.

It is realized by STC12LE5A60S2 microcontroller and RDA5820NS FM transmitter/receiver chip.

Status
----------

Won first prize.

Abilities
----------

- [x] Transmitter powered by two AA batteries.
- [x] Analog FM, carrier frequency range 88MHz to 108MHz, max drift 75kHz, Audio bandwidth 40Hz~15kHz.
- [x] Antenna length less than 0.5 meters. Ordinary FM receivers can receive signal. No significant distotion.
